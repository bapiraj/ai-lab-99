# ‚ö° Energy Consumption Prediction (Multiple Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates a **Multiple Linear Regression** model with two features (temperature and humidity) to predict energy consumption.  
It includes the full workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training, interpretation, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit app.
