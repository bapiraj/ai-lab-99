# üè† Housing Price Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates a **Simple Linear Regression** model with one feature (house area) to predict housing prices.  
It includes the full workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit app.
